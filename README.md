# Urban-Planning-sample-project-arduino-
Urban areas are becoming more limited in their available land for farming. With this system that we have created out of e-waste, we are trying to make a favourable environment for the plant to grow using real-time sensing and monitoring the plant.
Itâ€™s an efficient method for space utilisation and for proper nourishment of plant.
We are not only using area but also volume as this system is stackable. (cubic space utilisation)
# FUTURE SCOPE:
Plant monitoring system using IoT and ML : a system must be developed where plants can communicate with users
An IoT based Home automation system: capable of monitoring weather conditions
An Interface can be made for detecting gas concentration level
By measuring longitudinal and latitudinal extents , system can be made portable by using RC
AI and IoT based monitoring system for increasing yield in crop production
Automatic indoor hydroponic plant using Arduino
